# Astronomy
- The Branch of science dealing with the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere

> What genre of science is this?

**Atmosphere** \- Gaseous layer surrounding Earth or another heavenly body.

> The atmosphere is a collection of gasses held to the earth by *Gravity*

**Gravity** \- Force of attraction existing between any 2 masses.

> Gravity also holds *sattelites* in orbit

**Sattelite** \- A celestial body orbiting another of larger size

The Solar system is a *Sattelite* of Sagittarius A, which is the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way *galaxy*.

**Galaxy** \- Large gravitationally bound system of stars and interstellar matter

Usually, celestial bodies orbit a *[Barycenter](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/en/)*, rather than one body or another

**Barycenter** \- The point around which two objects orbit.

# Light (EM Radiation)
- Light energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation
  - It has both *particle* and *wave* properties

## Light is a particle
- The light you see is a string of photons

- Light does not require a medium to travel through (unlike sound)

- This is why there is no sound in space, but there is still light.

- Light travels fastest when there is no medium

- The speed of light in a vacuum is c (3.00 * 10^8 m/s, 9.71 * 10^8 mph)

## Light is a wave

![wavelength and amplitude](https://static.sciencelearn.org.nz/images/images/000/000/061/full/Wave-length-height-and-frequency20150805-30600-ac3hjmedited.png?1625099274)

- Light is governed by equations concerning waves

- v = f * λ
  - **v = velocity (m/s)**

  - **f = frequency (1/s)**

  - **λ = wavelength (m)**

- brighter light has a higher *amplitude*


## Examples of Light

### Colors Chart

| Spectral region | Range of wavelength (nm) | Subregion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ultraviolet | 100-280 </br> 280-315  </br> 315-380 | UV-C </br> UV-B </br> UV-A |
Visible | 380-430 </br> 430-500 </br> 500-520 </br> 520-565 </br> 565-580 </br> 580-625 </br> 625-740 | Violet </br> Blue </br> Cyan </br> Green </br> Yellow </br> Orange </br> Red | 
Infrared | 740-1400 </br> 1400-10000 | Near IR </br> Far IR |

## Other EM Radiation
There are many kinds of EM radiation that are outside the spectrum of *Visible light*

### Higher Energy
- Ultraviolet Light
- X-Rays
- Gamma Rays

### Lower Energy
- Infrared
- Radar
- Frequency modulation (FM) Radio
- Amplitude modulation (AM) Radio
