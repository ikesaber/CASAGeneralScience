# The Ideal Gas Law
PV = nRT
- P: Pressure
- V: Volume
- n: Amount of gas
- R: Gas Constant (ideal molar gas constant)
- T: Temperature

# Basic Meteorology
- **Meteorology** studies the atmosphere, particularly the weather

- **Weather** - The state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time

- **Climate** - The weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period

## How is Meteorology studied?

- Temperature
- Pressure
- Humidity
- Wind direction
- Wind speed

## [Where do Santa Ana Winds come from?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pNQ4g4zOwY)

Santa ana winds blow from inland
- Easterly (comes from the east)
- Dry (can be warm) (It comes over the desert)
- comes from a large high pressure system in the east or north east
  - usually from the Arizona New Mexico Utah Navada
- Air passes over the Mojave High Desert
  - This dries the air
- Air passes over the San Gabriel Mountains, and usually passes through narrow canyons 
  - This causes decompressional cooling at the top of the mountains and compressional heating at the bottom
  - Squeezing through the canyons causes the air to speed up to 100 mph
