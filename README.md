## About this repository:

This is a repository for CASA General Science Curriculum. As we only meet once per week, the majority of the course will be self-paced, following the schedule starting on page 15 of your student workbook. The coursework will generally follow this schedule, but [/Schedule.md](/Schedule.md) contains all the class-by-class instructions I expect you to follow. I will make periodic changes as the course progresses, so please notify me by email if you see anything broken or unusual. 

## Other Notes

- If you are worried you are not getting my emails, have a look at [/Announcments](/Announcements) to ensure you don't miss anything.

## About GitHub 

For anybody who's unfamiliar with GitHub, It functions very similarly to a file manager (like *File Explorer* *Finder*, or *Nautilus*). Use the *file navigation box* to navigate to new files or directories, use the *file viewer box* to view the files themselves, and the *breadcrumbs* at the top of the page to keep track of the directory you are inside.

Websites built on git are designed for posting publicly available source-code for applications on the internet, such that they may be downloaded to your computer as new updates are published. I am using it to host all the course content because I want to familiarize students with how to use online git repositories, and I want the content of the course to be available to everybody.
