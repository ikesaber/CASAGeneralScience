# Introduction

- Ask students something they learned in class
- Administer test when all students arrive

# Density lab

## OBSERVATION - The ping pong ball floats because it is *less dense* than the fluid in which it is suspended.

***Weight*** \- Mass (kg)
***Density*** \- Mass per unit volume (kg/m^3)

## RESEARCH - What is the ping pong ball made of?

- Plastic ball (solid)
- Air inside (fluid)

> Water and Air are both fluids - they conform uniformly to the space they occupy.
> You can blow bubbles of air into water that 

- Perforate one ping pong ball and suspend two ping pong balls in the water
	- Air rises out of the pppb and is replaced by water.

## HYPOTHESIS 

- Make an educated guess - Will the plastic ball float or sink when the air is removed and only the plastic is suspended in water?

### Hypothesis 1: The plastic without air is less dense than the water in which it is suspended (it will float).

### Hypothesis 2: The plastic without air is more dense than the water in which it is suspended (it will sink).

## EXPERIMENT - Release the ping pong ball(s) and compare the behavior of the air-filled and the water-filled balls when suspended in water

## Conclusion - Did our hypothesis accurately predict the outcome of our experiment?

- If our hypothesis predicted the outcome of our experiment, then it has been validated.
    
    > It IS the case that {The plastic without air is less dense than the water in which it is suspended (it will float).}
    
- If our hypothesis did not predict the outcome of our experiment, then it has not been validated.
    
    > It IS NOT the case that {The plastic without air is less dense than the water in which it is suspended (it will float).}
    
- Being wrong can be usefule because the data gathered may be used to support an *alternative hypothesis*, But your job is much easier if you are right the first time:
	- You can move deeper into examining your hypothesis, instead of having to revise and retest it.
	- Your findings are more likely to be published (*publication bias*).

## Operational and Historical Science

- ***Operational Science*** \- science that uses the traditional tools of observation and experimentation.
- ***Historical Science*** \- science that pieces together historical events in order to explain and create models.

### Example: 

- Measuring intelligence over time using a *cohort study* (operational) compared to looking at changes in technology and development during a time period to infer intelligence (historical).

> both are evaluated with the [same criteria](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Class1/Class1Notes.md#What-makes-good-science)

## Theology / religion can be used as a *hueristic* for understanding the world

- ***Hueristic*** \- Problem-solving method that is sufficient for immediate solutions or approximations.
    
    - Hueristics tend to be *accurate*, but not necessarily *specific*
        
    - Hueristics are useful when you do not want / need to spend time and energy to creating a very precise worldview.

> Whereas more precice findings can be made using the scientific method, hueristics can be used to make general rules

### Examples of religious laws as hueristics

- Nearly all relgions have pronouncements against *homosexuality* and *hypergamy*

> Avoids unhealthy behavior - low-to-no fertility, high rates of sexual disease, damage to body

- Old Testament Laws and Kosher - avoids certain foods like pork and shellfish

> Avoids disease from undercooked food

- Mormon and Islamic pronouncements against alcohol (Christianity forbids drunkenness)

> Avoids alchoholism, liver damage, unsafe behaviors due to drunkenness

***Science and religous traditions are both used to understand the same world***

## Worldviews and values determine your response to scientific data

> The way the world **IS** does not dictate how we **OUGHT** to deal with it.

**Instead:**

> **IF** we want something, **THEN** scientific models can tell us how to get it.

Science tells us how to do stuff, so disagreements may arise based on **worldviews**
