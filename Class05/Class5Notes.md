# Etymology
- Etymo = "linguistic form"
- \-logy = "divine sayings or principles"
- Etymology is the principles of the forms of words
- Biology is the principles of life

## Dendrochronology

- Also called "tree-ring dating" - the scientific method of dating tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed
- "Dendro" = "branch", "chronology" = "time study"
- Trees develop about one ring per year, large rings reflect years of large growth.

## [Formal Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_formal_science#Logic)

- More concerned with *formal systems* and their definitions and rules than empirical validation (observation and experimentation)

### Example Branches

- [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_formal_science#Logic) \- Study of reasoning
- [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_formal_science#Mathematics) \- Study of numbers, formulas and related structures
- [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_formal_science#Statistics) \- Collection and analysis of large quantities of numerical data
- [Systems Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_formal_science#Systems_science) \- Study of systems \- interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole
- [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_formal_science#Computer_science) \- Study of computation, automation, and information


## [Natural Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_natural_science#Branches_of_natural_science)

- Description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation

### Example Branches

- [Biology (Life Sciences)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_natural_science#Life_Science) \- Study of life / living organisms
- [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_natural_science#Physics) \- Study of matter, motion, energy and force
- [Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_natural_science#Chemistry) \- Study of material properties and behavior
- [Geoscience (Earth Sciences)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_natural_science#Earth_Science) \- Study of earth and its properties

## [Social Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_social_science)

- Study of society, human behavior, and social relationships

- Some disciplines may not be considered scientific at all (e.g. gender studies)

### [Example Branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_social_science#Branches_of_social_science)

- Psychology \- Study of the mind and behavior
- Political Science \- Study of managing behavior
- Economics \- Study of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services
- Anthropology \- Study of humanity - human behavior, human biology, cultures, societies, and linguistics
- Archaeology \- Study of the past through material remains


## [Applied Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_applied_science#Branches_of_applied_science)

- Applying existing scientific knowledge to develop practical applications.
- Sometimes referred to as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)

### Example Branches
- Healthcare & Medicine (biology or chemistry)
- Agriculture (biology)
- Engineering (chemistry or physics)
- Electronics (computer science or physics)
- Actuarial Science (statistical risk assessment)
- Many more examples 

### Applications usually involve developments in technology
**Technology** - Application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry 

# There is a lot of *interdiciplinary* crossover between fields
- Biochemsitry, biophysics, bioinformatics, biopsychology, for example
- Many scientists will contribute to diciplines outside their specialization

# Epistemological tests | Fact-checking

### Internal Test
- Tests whether a claim does not contradict itself (*internally consistent*)

### External Test 
- Test whether a claim does not contradict externally known facts

### Bibliographic Test 
- Test whether a claim is not tainted by corruption of menaing (like typos or translation errors)

# Other areas of note:

## The Law of Superposition (Archaeology)
- In undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the sequence
