Hello everyone, 

Since we didn't have class today, please send me your lab write-ups for experiments 2.1 and 2.2 by email so I can have a look at them before our next class. You can take the class 1 [***quiz***](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Class2Quiz.md) Next week. Also have a look at the updated [schedule](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Schedule.md#class-3-20-sep-2022-tue-3---4pm-casa-general-science) and complete the assignments listed there.

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions
