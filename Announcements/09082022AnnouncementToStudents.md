Hello Everyone,

I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday! As I mentioned in class, all of the course materials are available on my [GitHub (github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience)](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience), including the [*class schedule*](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Schedule.md), [*notes from class*](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Class1Notes.md), and the [***quiz questions***](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Class2Quiz.md) for next class, as well as links to the answers ;). Feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

Regards,

Isaac DeHart
