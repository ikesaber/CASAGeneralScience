Hi Everyone,

I've made some changes to the [class repository](https://www.github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience) for you to review, [including a primer on using the repository](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/README.md#about-github) itself.

If you have not sent me your lab reports from prior weeks, please do so as soon as possible so I can grade them. See the [class schedule](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/blob/main/Schedule.md) for a list of assignments.

**To parents:** A few students told me they had not received my previous emails; to avoid confusion, make sure your student is getting my emails regarding the course AND is able to access the [announcements](https://github.com/ikesaber/CASAGeneralScience/tree/main/Announcements) page if email is unavailable to them.

Thank you.
