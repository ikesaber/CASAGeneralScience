# What is Science?

**Science** \- Systematic study through observation and experimentation

***The Scientific Method***

1.  Observation - Observe something to study
2.  Hypothesis - A guess that explains an observation or answers a question
3.  Experiment - Procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or refine a theory or law
4.  Theory / Law - Explanation / description based on repeated successful predictions
    - ***Law*** \- *Description or principle of what phenomena occur* that is supported by a significant amount of evidence
        - often uses mathematics to make predictions
    - ***Theory*** \- *Explanation of why a phenomena occur* that is supported by a significant amount of evidence

# What makes good science?

> Example: I am studying the effect of flipping a light switch on a light. 

1.  ***Predictive validity*** \- Theories and laws must by justified by making valid predictions.

> If I predict that flipping the switch will turn on a light and it does not, my prediction is *not valid* 

2.  ***Falsifiability*** \- Theories and laws must be falsifiable - able to stand up to scrutiny or be disproven.

> If I predict that flipping a switch will make something happen, my prediction may be *unfalsifiable*

3.  ***Reproducibility*** \- Capacity for a scientific finding to be found independently using the same methodology.

> If I report flipping the switch turned on the light, but somebody else reports flipping the lightswitch did not turn on the light, my finding *failed to replicate*

4.  ***Precision*** and ***Accuracy***
- ***Accuracy*** \- How close or far off a given set of measurements (observations or readings) are to their true value.
- ***Precision*** \- How close or dispersed your measurements are to each other.

> More precision and accuracy is better

# Determining causation from correlation

> *Correlation does not necessarily equal causation*

### Example: Does criminality in a city rise with ice cream sales?

> it could be a law because it describes what "phenomena happen"

- Refinement of a hypothesis or theory requires that you control for *confounders*

## Dependent, Independent, and Confounding Variables
***Independent variable*** \- *Cause*. Its value is *independent* of other variables in your study.
***Dependent variable*** \- *Effect*. Its value *depends* on changes in the independent variable.
***Confounding variable*** \- a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable (making it just another *dependent variable*)

![confoundIndependentDependentVariables](https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/confound2-1024x500.png)

Theory / Law must hold up when confounders are *controlled*

## Science as an institution

> "Science says" or "Trust the science" or "Scientists agree" or "experts agree"

This is "logos", or "appeal to authority", not an application of the scientific method

- People use these as ***heuristics*** for their beliefs about how the world works
    
- ***Heuristic*** \- Problem-solving method that is sufficient for immediate solutions or approximations.
    
- ***Peer review*** \- Evaluation of work by one or more people of similar competence to the producers of the work.

## Notes on Studying

- Write stuff down when you study
- Be prepared for a quiz on the material at the beginning of each class
