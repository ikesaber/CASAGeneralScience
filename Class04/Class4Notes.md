# Weight of objects affect the speed at which they fall.

## Introduction 

### Hypothesis

It was hypothesized that a heavier object will fall at the same rate as a lighter object.

## Materials & Methods 

### Materials

An 8.5" by 11" by 0.75" book, an 8.5" by 11" sheet of cardboard, 8.5" by 11" heavy cardstock paper, and 8.5" by 11" regular printer paper were used during our trials.

### Procedure 

To compare the rates at which objects of different weight fall, two of the objects were held facing vertically 1.7 meters from the ground and dropped simultaneously, and the order in which the objects landed was recorded. Three trials were conducted, comparing the book to cardboard, cardboard to heavy paper, and heavy paper to regular paper.

## Data & Results

In trial one, the book landed before the cardboard. In trial two, the cardboard landed before the heavy paper. In trial three, the heavy paper landed before the regular paper

## Conclusion

Our hypothesis was not validated by the three experimental trials. It was found that the heavier materials land more quickly when dropped simultaneously from the same height, with the book landing first, the cardboard second, the cardstock third, and the printer paper last. We therefore conclude that it is not the case that the weight of an object does not affect the rate at which it falls when dropped. However, more research is needed to study whether the size of an object impacts its rate of fall.

# The Rate at Which Objects is Affected by Shape, Not by Weight

## Introduction

Previous experimentation indicates that heavier objects fall more quickly than lighter objects. However, it has yet to be determined whether the size or shape of an object account for this effect rather than weight. To elucidate the effect of object size on fall speed, a smaller object must be compared to previous materials.

## Materials & Methods

### Materials

An 8.5" by 11" by 0.75" book, 8.5" by 11" sheet of cardboard, 8.5" by 11" heavy cardstock paper, 8.5" by 11" regular printer paper and a paperclip were used during our trials.

### Procedure

To measure the affect of object size and shape on fall speed, four trials were conducted comparing the paperclip to the book, cardboard, heavy paper, and regular paper, respectively. The objects were held 1.7 meters from the ground facing vertically and dropped simultaneously. The order in which the objects landed was recorded. Subsequently, three additional trials were conducted comparing the book, cardboard, and heavy paper to a wadded up ball of printer paper. 

## Data and results 

In all trials, the paperclip fell to the ground faster than the book, cardboard, cardstock, and printer paper , with other materials Similarly, the wadded up printer paper landed more quickly than the book, cardboard, and cardstock.
