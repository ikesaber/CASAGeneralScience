# Designing a Scientific Experiment

## Variables and Groups 

- **Experimental variable** \- Independent variable which you are changing / studying. 
- **Control Group** \- The standard group to which comparisons are made in an experiment (experimental variable is not manipulated).
  - **Placebo** (often given to a control group) \- Medicine or procedure prescribed for psychological benefit to the patient rather than for any physiological effect.
- **Treatment Group** \- Group in which the experimental variable is manipulated.

## Blinding your experiment 

- **Blind Experiment** \- Experiment in which information is withheld from participants / subjects until after the experiment is complete.
- **Double-blind Experiment** \- Experiment in which infrmation is withheld from participants / subjects *AND* experimenters until after the experiment is complete.

*Blinding experiments helps eliminate **bias***
- Psychosomatic effects (prevent with blinding)
- Corruption (prevent with double blinding)

# Creating a figure 

**Always include:**

- Title \- should be clearly differentiated from the rest of the description (i.e., by larger bold font)
- Axes Labels \- label the gradations of your graph 
- Axes Titles (with units of measurement)
- Data Points \- Use different marker styles for each data series
- Legend \- a key to identify each data series

**Sometimes Include**

- Figure Number (Figure number and description should be below figure)
- Figure Description \- Specifically describe what is being shown
- Raw Data \- table of data that is included in the report
- Labels for Data Table (label columns in data table to indicate what each column represents)
